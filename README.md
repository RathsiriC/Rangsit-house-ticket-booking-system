# Rangsit-house-ticket-booking-system

This project is to develop a Rangsit House ticket booking database system under the topic of the
cinema booking system, which provides a website for a cinema hall that any internet user can access. This
system is required users to log in before using the system and is needed a smartphone is needed for paying
the tickets. The paper also describes the functional business requirements, sample data, software code,
and user interface. Here we report an ER diagram including entities and attributes, table details in SQL
language through MySQL server on the XAMPP, a control panel context diagram, and a data flow
diagram to guide the functional design. For implementing the function of online cinema ticket booking
management, the requirement function, overall structure, and designed software codes in detail following
the diagrams. In addition, we constructed the user interface appearances through Figma and used HTML,
CSS, PHP and JavaScript for coding the front end. Thus, the online booking ticket system is one of the
alternative choices for those who cannot afford enough time to get their tickets before watching a movie.
People can book tickets online at any time of day or night.
